{"name":"Cowboy","tagline":"A pluggable parallel execution tool implemented with Node.js and Redis","body":"**Cowboy** is a light-weight, easy-to-install tool that lassoes a large number of servers together in order to perform execution tasks or gather diagnostic information from nodes in parallel. At its core, Cowboy simply facilitates a framework and infrastructure that allows plugins to be implemented that do useful things. We give you these commands to get you started:\r\n\r\n* `describe` - Describes the modules and commands available to all listening cattle nodes\r\n* `install` - Installs a new cowboy module on all listening cattle nodes\r\n* `ping` - Interrogates the network for cattle nodes that are listening for commands\r\n* `uninstall` - Uninstalls an installed cowboy module on all listening cattle nodes\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst [download and install Redis](http://redis.io/download), make sure it's listening on port 6379.\r\n\r\nInstall [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/bunyan) and Cowboy:\r\n\r\n`npm install -g bunyan cowboy`\r\n\r\n## Simple Usage\r\n\r\nCowboy is made up of 2 components, the cattle server and the cowboy client. The Cattle server listens and executes commands when run from the cowboy client.\r\n\r\nFirst start up the Cattle server:\r\n\r\n`cattle | bunyan`\r\n\r\nIn a new terminal, run a command:\r\n\r\n`cowboy ping`\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHost                      Latency\r\nbranden-macbook.local     13ms\r\n\r\nPing Statistics:\r\nAvg: 13.00ms\r\nMin: 13ms\r\nMax: 13ms\r\nTmt: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's just that easy.
