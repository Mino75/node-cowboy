        <p><strong>Cowboy</strong> is a light-weight, easy-to-install tool that lassoes a large number of servers together in order to perform execution tasks or gather diagnostic information from nodes in parallel. At its core, Cowboy simply facilitates a framework and infrastructure that allows plugins to be implemented that do useful things. We have a few helpful core plugins to get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>describe</code> - Describes the modules and commands available to all listening cattle nodes</li>
<li>
<code>install</code> - Installs a new cowboy module on all listening cattle nodes</li>
<li>
<code>ping</code> - Interrogates the network for cattle nodes that are listening for commands</li>
<li>
<code>uninstall</code> - Uninstalls an installed cowboy module on all listening cattle nodes</li>
</ul><p>And the rest is up to you!</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>First <a href="http://redis.io/download">download and install Redis</a>, make sure it's listening on port 6379.</p>

<p>Then install the cowboy module:</p>

<p><code>npm -g install cowboy</code></p>

<p>Since Cowboy uses <a href="https://github.com/trentm/bunyan">Bunyan</a> for logging, it's best to install globally as well for piping log output:</p>

<p><code>npm -g install bunyan</code></p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Cowboy is made up of 2 components:</p>

<p><strong>Cattle:</strong> The cattle binary listens to commands issued from the cowboy command VIA Redis. There must be a cattle process running on each server node that you control with Cowboy. This can be started by simply running: <code>cattle | bunyan</code>. For use in production, you will want to use something like <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">Forever</a> or Upstart to run it as a daemon process.</p>

<p><strong>Cowboy:</strong> The cowboy module is the command-line client where commands can be executed. To see options, type: <code>cowboy --help</code></p>
